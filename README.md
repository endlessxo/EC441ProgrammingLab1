EC441ProgrammingLab1
====================

Lab 1 of Networking, gets the .html content. 

Change the port on server_address = ('localhost' random_number_that_you_want)
Go to chrome/safari/internet explorer and type in 
	'127.0.0.1:random_number_that_you_want/HelloWorld.html'
Nothing will show up on the client side, but on the server you will see either a 200 with the HTML content,
or.. 404 not found.
